## Snowball Engine: a new way to convert rooms

Snowball Engine is a fancy name for how we recreate Club Penguin's rooms in Godot. Converting rooms is a manual and slow process, so here is a guide on how to make it a little less painfull ;)

### Setting up the enviroment
1. Download your room

Download the room's Flash File. We highly recommend using [the Club Penguin Rewritten Archives](https://rewrittenarchives.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page)

2. Use JPEXS Free Flash Decompiler

You can download it [here](https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler)

3. Export the room frame

Right click on the frame of the room you want to convert and choose the option "Export selection"

Choose the scale of 120% (export every sprite with this scale)

### Recreate the room

This is the most _painful_ part. Export each sprite you want to put inside your room and place it in the same position of the frame.

**Tip:** Adjust the frame's opacity to help you visualize if you're placing the object in the right position.

### Soundtracking the room
We reccomend downloading soundtracks from [Club Penguin Music Station](https://www.youtube.com/@clubpenguinmusicstation).
