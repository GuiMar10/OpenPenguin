## Snowball Engine: a new way to convert rooms
Snowball Engine is a fancy name for how we recreate Club Penguin's rooms in Godot. Converting rooms is a manual and slow process, so we wrote a guide on how to make it a little less painful ;)

You can read it [here](https://github.com/GuiMar10/OpenPenguin/blob/main/docs/snowball_engine.md)
Hopefully sometime in the future the migration will be easier. Please stay tuned and Waddle On!
